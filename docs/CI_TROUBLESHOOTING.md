# CI troubleshooting

**Last updated:** July 28, 2026

Quick reference for red checks on NOBS pull requests and `main`.

---

## Check overview

| Check | Workflow | Typical cause | Code fix? |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Python 3.12 on Tank** | Backend CI | Test/lint failure | Yes — run `python3 scripts/dev.py check` |
| **Python 3.12 on Mac runner** | Backend CI | Same | Yes |
| **docs-only-auto-approve** | Auto-approve safe PRs | Stale run on `ubuntu-latest`, or tank runner offline | Re-run after tank workflow on `main`; not an app bug |
| **NOBS \| Default \| Build - iOS** | Xcode Cloud (App Store Connect) | Compile or signing on Apple’s builders | Maybe — check ASC build logs |
| **TestFlight** | `.github/workflows/testflight.yml` | Development cert missing on CI keychain; distribution profiles | **Home** — runner + Apple Developer portal. Manual options: refresh signing only, upload staged IPA (`~/nobs-build/NOBS.ipa`), or account cleanup. |
| **NOBSTests** | Backend CI `ios-macos` job | Swift compile or routing fixture drift | Yes — `bash scripts/test-ios.sh` |

## docs-only-auto-approve (failure in ~1s, no steps)

**What it is:** Optional bot that auto-approves documentation-only PRs from owners/collaborators. It does **not** run your tests. For mixed PRs (code + docs), it should **pass** with “Not a docs-only PR; no auto-approval needed.”

**Common failure message (often misleading):**

> The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased.

**What this usually means (not necessarily a broken credit card):**

- The job **never ran** — zero steps, ~2–4s duration, `runner_id: 0`.
- Inspect the job labels in the Actions UI. If they show **`ubuntu-latest`**, the workflow on **`main` at run time** still targeted GitHub-hosted runners. GitHub often shows the billing/spending-limit message when a hosted job cannot be scheduled — including **Actions minutes spending caps** — even when the payment method is fine.
- **`pull_request_target` always uses the workflow file on `main`**, not the PR branch. A PR that changes `auto-approve.yml` to `self-hosted, tank` does not fix the check until that change is on `main` **and** the workflow is re-run.

**Verified on this repo (July 2026):**

- Failed PR #38 runs: labels `ubuntu-latest`, billing annotation, no steps.
- After `main` switched to `[self-hosted, tank]` (PR #39), PR #41’s `docs-only-auto-approve` **passed in ~30s** on the tank runner — same workflow, no billing issue.

**What to do:**

1. **Re-run** the failed workflow from the PR Checks tab (or push/rebase to trigger a new run). Stale reds from before the tank-runner fix will not clear on their own.
2. Confirm `main` has `runs-on: [self-hosted, tank]` in `.github/workflows/auto-approve.yml`.
3. Confirm the `tank` runner is online: GitHub → Settings → Actions → Runners (Backend CI “Python on Tank” passing is a good signal).
4. Only if **new** runs still target `ubuntu-latest` or hosted runners fail while tank works: check [Actions spending limits](https://github.com/settings/billing) (minutes cap, not always “payment failed”).
5. Optional: remove `docs-only-auto-approve` from **required** branch protection — it is a convenience bot, not a product test.

## TestFlight (main push — Archive failed)

**Latest known error on `main` (July 2026):**

```text
No signing certificate "iOS Development" found … private key is not installed in your keychain.
```

**What the workflow does now:**

1. Create an ephemeral CI keychain — **no `DIST_CERT_P12` secret**.
2. Provision iPhone Developer + Apple Distribution certificates via App Store Connect API ([`ci-ensure-signing-certs.sh`](../scripts/ci-ensure-signing-certs.sh)).
3. Archive/export with automatic signing and `-allowProvisioningUpdates`.

**Required secrets:** `ASC_API_KEY_ID`, `ASC_API_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_API_KEY_CONTENT` only.

**If archive still fails:**

1. Confirm the three ASC API secrets are set and the key has **Developer** access in App Store Connect.
2. Confirm `fastlane` is on the `testflight` runner (`brew install fastlane`).
3. [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) → Identifiers → App Group + Sign in with Apple on both App IDs.
4. Re-run TestFlight workflow from Actions.

**Older error (July 7, 2026):**

```text
"NOBSWidgets" requires a provisioning profile with the App Groups feature.
```

## NOBS | Default | Build - iOS (Xcode Cloud)

**What it is:** Apple’s Xcode Cloud build attached to the App Store Connect app — separate from GitHub Actions TestFlight.

**When it fails:**

- Open the link in the check → App Store Connect → build logs.
- PR #40 failed here while backend CI passed; PR #38 passed — compare Swift/project changes.
- Common causes: new Swift files not added to `NOBS.xcodeproj`, widget target missing shared sources, signing on Apple’s side.

**Simulator-only validation (no signing):**

```bash
./scripts/build-ios-simulator.sh
```

---

## Backend CI (real code failures)

```bash
python3 scripts/dev.py setup
python3 scripts/dev.py check
bash scripts/test-ios.sh
```

Fix any failing tests or lint before pushing.

## PosterBoard quit unexpectedly (local Mac / Simulator)

**What it is:** macOS dialog spam from the **iOS Simulator** lock-screen / wallpaper stack (`PosterBoard`, often `MercuryPosterExtension`), not a NOBS app crash. Common on recent Xcode betas when a Simulator runtime ships without usable default wallpaper assets; `ReportCrash` may peg CPU.

**Fast fix**

1. Boot the simulator you use for NOBS (usually iPhone 17 Pro).
2. In the simulator: **Settings → Wallpaper** (or Photos → Use as Wallpaper) and set **any** image for Lock Screen **and** Home Screen.
3. Confirm `ReportCrash` / `MercuryPosterExtension` CPU drops in Activity Monitor within ~a minute.

**If it keeps looping**

- Try a sibling runtime (e.g. iOS 27.0 instead of a broken point release) via `NOBS_SIMULATOR_OS` / scheme destination.
- Erase that simulator device (`xcrun simctl erase <udid>`), boot, and set wallpaper immediately.
- Re-download the Simulator runtime in Xcode → Settings → Platforms.

Full Mac audit (PosterBoard + Apple account cleanup): paste [`CODEX_APPLE_ACCOUNT_AUDIT_PROMPT.md`](CODEX_APPLE_ACCOUNT_AUDIT_PROMPT.md) into Codex on the home Mac.

## Handoff

When a check’s root cause changes (e.g. provisioning fixed, billing resolved), update this file in the same PR that addresses it.
