# CI troubleshooting

**Last updated:** July 28, 2026

Quick reference for red checks on NOBS pull requests and `main`.

---

## Check overview

| Check | Workflow | Typical cause | Code fix? |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Python 3.12 on Tank** | Backend CI | Test/lint failure | Yes — run `python3 scripts/dev.py check` |
| **Python 3.12 on Mac runner** | Backend CI | Same | Yes |
| **docs-only-auto-approve** | Auto-approve safe PRs | Stale run on `ubuntu-latest`, or tank runner offline | Re-run after tank workflow on `main`; not an app bug |
| **NOBS \| Default \| Build - iOS** | Xcode Cloud (App Store Connect) | Compile or signing on Apple’s builders | Maybe — check ASC build logs |
| **TestFlight** | `.github/workflows/testflight.yml` | Development cert missing on CI keychain; distribution profiles | **Home** — runner + Apple Developer portal. Manual options: refresh signing only, upload staged IPA (`~/nobs-build/NOBS.ipa`), or account cleanup. |
| **NOBSTests** | Backend CI `ios-macos` job | Swift compile or routing fixture drift | Yes — `bash scripts/test-ios.sh` |

## docs-only-auto-approve (failure in ~1s, no steps)

**What it is:** Optional bot that auto-approves documentation-only PRs from owners/collaborators. It does **not** run your tests. For mixed PRs (code + docs), it should **pass** with “Not a docs-only PR; no auto-approval needed.”

**Common failure message (often misleading):**

> The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased.

**What this usually means (not necessarily a broken credit card):**

- The job **never ran** — zero steps, ~2–4s duration, `runner_id: 0`.
- Inspect the job labels in the Actions UI. If they show **`ubuntu-latest`**, the workflow on **`main` at run time** still targeted GitHub-hosted runners. GitHub often shows the billing/spending-limit message when a hosted job cannot be scheduled — including **Actions minutes spending caps** — even when the payment method is fine.
- **`pull_request_target` always uses the workflow file on `main`**, not the PR branch. A PR that changes `auto-approve.yml` to `self-hosted, tank` does not fix the check until that change is on `main` **and** the workflow is re-run.

**Verified on this repo (July 2026):**

- Failed PR #38 runs: labels `ubuntu-latest`, billing annotation, no steps.
- After `main` switched to `[self-hosted, tank]` (PR #39), PR #41’s `docs-only-auto-approve` **passed in ~30s** on the tank runner — same workflow, no billing issue.

**What to do:**

1. **Re-run** the failed workflow from the PR Checks tab (or push/rebase to trigger a new run). Stale reds from before the tank-runner fix will not clear on their own.
2. Confirm `main` has `runs-on: [self-hosted, tank]` in `.github/workflows/auto-approve.yml`.
3. Confirm the `tank` runner is online: GitHub → Settings → Actions → Runners (Backend CI “Python on Tank” passing is a good signal).
4. Only if **new** runs still target `ubuntu-latest` or hosted runners fail while tank works: check [Actions spending limits](https://github.com/settings/billing) (minutes cap, not always “payment failed”).
5. Optional: remove `docs-only-auto-approve` from **required** branch protection — it is a convenience bot, not a product test.

## TestFlight (main push — Archive failed)

**Latest known error on `main` (July 2026):**

```text
No signing certificate "iOS Development" found … private key is not installed in your keychain.
```

**What the workflow does now:**

1. Create an ephemeral CI keychain — **no `DIST_CERT_P12` secret**.
2. Provision iPhone Developer + Apple Distribution certificates via App Store Connect API ([`ci-ensure-signing-certs.sh`](../scripts/ci-ensure-signing-certs.sh)).
3. Archive/export with automatic signing and `-allowProvisioningUpdates`.

**Required secrets:** `ASC_API_KEY_ID`, `ASC_API_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_API_KEY_CONTENT` only.

**If archive still fails:**

1. Confirm the three ASC API secrets are set and the key has **Developer** access in App Store Connect.
2. Confirm `fastlane` is on the `testflight` runner (`brew install fastlane`).
3. [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) → Identifiers → App Group + Sign in with Apple on both App IDs.
4. Re-run TestFlight workflow from Actions.

**Older error (July 7, 2026):**

```text
"NOBSWidgets" requires a provisioning profile with the App Groups feature.
```

Team: `K853LKQLAS` — Bundle IDs: `com.nobsdash.nobs`, `com.nobsdash.nobs.widgets`

### ⚠️ Every run creates a new distribution certificate

**Check the certificate count before dispatching this workflow.** Observed on the August 14, 2026 `refresh_signing_only` run:

```text
Couldn't find an existing certificate... creating a new one
Successfully generated 6WR47HHPR4
```

`ci-prepare-keychain.sh` builds an empty keychain on every run, so `fastlane cert` never finds the existing certificate's private key and issues a **new** Apple Distribution certificate each time. The standard Apple Developer Program allows **three**. That run took the team from two to three.

This matters because of what happens at the limit. In [`ci-ensure-signing-certs.sh`](../scripts/ci-ensure-signing-certs.sh), a failed creation falls through to `ci-revoke-distribution-certs.py`, which revokes **every** distribution certificate on the team and issues a fresh one. Revocation is not local to CI — it invalidates that certificate everywhere, including the Xcode install on the developer's own Mac.

So the sequence is: run at the limit → creation fails → all distribution certificates revoked.

**Before running again:**

1. Check Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Certificates and delete surplus **Apple Distribution** certificates, keeping the one in active use.
2. Treat a run at three certificates as unsafe until the keychain reuses an existing certificate instead of minting one.

The durable fix is for the CI keychain to import an existing distribution certificate (the unused `DIST_CERT_P12` / `DIST_CERT_PASSWORD` secrets exist for exactly this) rather than generating a new one per run.

### Certificate selection mismatch

The same run showed `fastlane` installing `6WR47HHPR4` into the CI keychain while [`ci-create-app-store-profiles.py`](../scripts/ci-create-app-store-profiles.py) selected a different certificate, `474FC3VL6X`, for the profiles:

```text
Successfully generated 6WR47HHPR4        # imported into the CI keychain
Using distribution certificate 474FC3VL6X # embedded in the profiles
```

`_distribution_certificate_id` takes the first Apple Distribution certificate the API returns, which is not necessarily the one whose private key is in the keychain. A profile built around a certificate the signing keychain cannot use will fail at archive time even when both steps report success. Pin the profile to the certificate actually installed before trusting a green signing run.

## NOBS | Default | Build - iOS (Xcode Cloud)

**What it is:** Apple’s Xcode Cloud build attached to the App Store Connect app — separate from GitHub Actions TestFlight.

**When it fails:**

- Open the link in the check → App Store Connect → build logs.
- PR #40 failed here while backend CI passed; PR #38 passed — compare Swift/project changes.
- Common causes: new Swift files not added to `NOBS.xcodeproj`, widget target missing shared sources, signing on Apple’s side.

**Simulator-only validation (no signing):**

```bash
./scripts/build-ios-simulator.sh
```

---

## Backend CI (real code failures)

```bash
python3 scripts/dev.py setup
python3 scripts/dev.py check
bash scripts/test-ios.sh
```

Fix any failing tests or lint before pushing.

## PosterBoard quit unexpectedly (local Mac / Simulator)

**What it is:** macOS dialog spam from the **iOS Simulator** lock-screen / wallpaper stack (`PosterBoard`, often `MercuryPosterExtension`), not a NOBS app crash. Common on recent Xcode betas when a Simulator runtime ships without usable default wallpaper assets; `ReportCrash` may peg CPU.

**Fast fix**

1. Boot the simulator you use for NOBS (usually iPhone 17 Pro).
2. In the simulator: **Settings → Wallpaper** (or Photos → Use as Wallpaper) and set **any** image for Lock Screen **and** Home Screen.
3. Confirm `ReportCrash` / `MercuryPosterExtension` CPU drops in Activity Monitor within ~a minute.

**If it keeps looping**

- Try a sibling runtime (e.g. iOS 27.0 instead of a broken point release) via `NOBS_SIMULATOR_OS` / scheme destination.
- Erase that simulator device (`xcrun simctl erase <udid>`), boot, and set wallpaper immediately.
- Re-download the Simulator runtime in Xcode → Settings → Platforms.

Full Mac audit (PosterBoard + Apple account cleanup): paste [`CODEX_APPLE_ACCOUNT_AUDIT_PROMPT.md`](CODEX_APPLE_ACCOUNT_AUDIT_PROMPT.md) into Codex on the home Mac.
